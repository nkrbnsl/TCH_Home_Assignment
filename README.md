Filtering &amp; Data Display


Intructions to run the program: 
1. Get the .ipnyb file and data file on local system. 
2. Run the each cell in the sense order. (Following the changes needed in for search filteration)
3. The last command should display the filtered data. 


Thoughts on testing the concerned script:
A simple unit test can be devised that will iteratively change the filtering conditions and compare the output with the filtered output, any error would indicate a failure, which should not happen given the current structure.
